## Add support for libraries that have subpackages

Without support for subpackages, libraries like [ponylang/semver](https://github.com/ponylang/semver) wouldn't have their documentation generated.

Semver has a package layout like this:

- semver
  - semver/range
  - semver/version

Without support for subpackages, `semver/range` and `semver/version` are removed from the generated documentation because they aren't seen as "being part of the library".
